\section{Self-trainable 3D-printed prosthetic hands}
This work demonstrates an architecture that can provide self-trainable
actions of sufficient quality to produce a high-performing prosthesis
with a low economic cost. We have produced and tested such a control
system for a very-low-cost 3D-printed prosthetic hand, and obtained
very high performance.  Obtaining sustainable high-quality
electromyography signals over the long term is still challenging,
however.  A more elaborately manufactured myography harness than was
possible with our prototype is necessary for undisturbed sensor signal
recording, which is directly connected to long-term performance at
high accuracy. Our future work will focus on embodied EEG-based prosthetic hands control with real amputee subjects' experiments.
